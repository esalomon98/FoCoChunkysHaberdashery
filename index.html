    <h1> Welcome to Chunky's Haberdashery!</h1>
    <br></br>

    <h2> About Us</h2>
    <p>Chunky’s Haberdashery is a modern pet company with your pets style and personality at heart. It all started when we adopted Chunky, an overweight one -eyed Chihuahua from our local shelter, and while he was missing an eye,
        he did not lack personality! Chunky’s personality was so big, that it simply could not be expressed through an ordinary pet store collar and leash. While he had a few signature bowties, we began making custom bowties for him
        for holidays and we would get stopped asking where we got his them! 
        Chunky’s Haberdashery was born, and hasn’t stopped growing since!</p>
<br></br>
    <p> We make custom and personalized leashes, harnesses and collars, bowls, custom engraved tags, and have one of the largest selections of dog clothing and accessories. We have styles for all
        dogs, ranging from pint-sized to extra large! While we are located in the heart of Northern California, we ship worldwide! While there are plenty of collars. leashes, and clothing for dogs out there,
        we have the largest selection and are a one stop shop for all, and ALL custom orders get free shipping! We look forward to outfitting your pup!</p>
